### Master presentation 
This is the presentation I gave during the defence of my [thesis](https://www.duo.uio.no/handle/10852/61196) in January 2018. It is written in *awful* html using [`reveal.js`](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/).

#### How to download and run
Download by[If you are using an old `git` version, you might have to instead use the command `> git clone --recursive git@github.com:mortele/Master-presentation.git`][1]
```
> git clone --recurse-submodules git@github.com:mortele/Master-presentation.git
```
The file `master-final.html` can now simply be opened in any browser to show the presentation. Pressing `S` will enter presenter mode, showing any notes defined in `<aside> </aside>` blocks for each slide.
